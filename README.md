# GIS Demonstration project with openlayers and React

This project demonstrates a React project that uses [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org)
to show an interactive map. It is used to teach web GIS concepts and development techniques.

The project covers:

* Basic displaying of a map
* Displaying points and polygons on a map from a GeoJSON source
* Changing background layers, including working with different projections
* Interacting with features on the map by clicking and panning
* Styling features on the map based on their properties
* Drawing objects on the map

## Material

* [Running application](https://jhannes.github.io/gis-kata/)
* [Reference branch](https://github.com/jhannes/gis-kata/tree/reference)
* [Java backend](https://github.com/jhannes/gis-kata/tree/java-poc) - an old variant showing Jetty and OpenAPI on the server side
